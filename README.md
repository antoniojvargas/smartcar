# smartcar# 🚗 Smartcar API

A Node.js + Express implementation of a **Smartcar-like API** that provides vehicle information, security status, fuel/battery levels, and engine control.  
The project follows clean architecture principles with controllers, services, and logging integration.

---

## 📑 Features

- **Vehicle Info** → `GET /vehicles/:id`
- **Door Security Status** → `GET /vehicles/:id/doors`
- **Fuel Level** → `GET /vehicles/:id/fuel`
- **Battery Level** → `GET /vehicles/:id/battery`
- **Start/Stop Engine** → `POST /vehicles/:id/engine`
- Structured **logging** using [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston).
- Unit tests with **Mocha + Chai + Sinon**.
- API documentation via **OpenAPI (Swagger)**.

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antoniojvargas/smartcar.git
cd smartcar
```

## 🐳 Running with Docker

This project is containerized using Docker Compose.
No need to install Node.js locally — just run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

This will:

- Build the smartcar image

- Start the container in development mode (nodemon)

- Expose the API on http://localhost:3000

To stop the container:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

Run the unit tests with Mocha + Chai + Sinon:

```bash
npm test
```

The test suite includes:

- ✅ Happy path responses

- ❌ Error handling (bad input, failed API responses)

- ⚡ Edge cases (incomplete/malformed data)

## 📘 API Endpoints

Vehicle Info

GET /vehicles/:id

## 📖 📖 Interactive API Documentation (Swagger UI)

You can explore and test all endpoints using the built-in Swagger UI:

➡️ http://localhost:3000/api-docs

This interactive documentation is automatically generated from the openapi.yml specification.

## 📝 Logging

Logging is handled by Winston:

- info → normal requests

- warn → API/data issues

- error → unexpected failures

Logs are printed to the console, and can be extended to files or external monitoring services.
